## Overview

This project is inspired by the **E-Ending of Nier Automata** and was created during my journey of learning **React Three Fiber**. Built with **Next.js**, the game logic is powered by **React Three Rapier**, and post-processing effects like **SSAO** are used to simulate the game's visual style.  

The project makes extensive use of ChatGPT to generate particle effects and some logic processing.
